Implement an accessible interactive “Prompt” window in Novapad (Win32) using ConPTY (Windows Pseudoconsole), designed for screen readers (NVDA).

Core requirement:
- Must work with true interactive TTY programs (e.g., Codex CLI).
- Do NOT use plain stdin/stdout pipes; use ConPTY.

Menu integration:
- Add a new command “Prompt” in the Tools (Strumenti) menu.
- Bind it to Ctrl+Shift+P to open or focus the Prompt window.

UI (accessibility-first):
- Create a new window/panel “Prompt”.
- Provide TWO main controls in this order:
  1) INPUT: single-line edit control where the user types commands.
  2) OUTPUT: read-only multiline text control showing the session transcript.
- Tab order MUST be: Input -> Output -> (optional buttons).
- Do not steal focus when new output arrives.
- OUTPUT must be fully selectable/copyable and readable with arrow keys by NVDA.

Keyboard behavior / hotkeys:
- Enter in INPUT: send the input text to the PTY with CRLF, then clear INPUT.
- Alt+I: focus INPUT.
- Alt+O: focus OUTPUT.
- Ctrl+C (when Prompt window is active): send an interrupt (CTRL_C_EVENT) to the child process.
- Ctrl+L: clear OUTPUT (with a simple safety confirmation or one-step restore).

PTY / process hosting:
- Use Win32 ConPTY (CreatePseudoConsole / HPCON).
- Start cmd.exe by default.
- Add a setting to choose the hosted program (cmd.exe / powershell.exe / codex).
- Read PTY output on a worker thread and append it to OUTPUT.
- Write user input to the PTY input pipe.

Minimal output filtering (required):
- Treat carriage return characters (\r) as “overwrite current line” instead of appending a new line.
- Strip common ANSI CSI escape sequences (e.g. \x1B[ ... m, K, G, J) to avoid spinner/progress artifacts.
- Keep filtering minimal; no full terminal emulation required.

Output handling:
- Provide an Auto-scroll toggle (default ON):
  - ON: keep view at bottom unless user is reviewing text.
  - OFF: never auto-scroll.
- Filtering must NOT break plain text output.

Resize:
- On Prompt window resize, update ConPTY size accordingly.

Settings (persisted):
- Hosted program command
- Auto-scroll (default ON)
- Strip ANSI (default ON)

Deliverables:
- New ConPTY/PTY module.
- Prompt window implementation with minimal output filtering.
- Short manual test checklist (cmd.exe + codex interactive).
- Run cargo test and cargo clippy --all and fix issues.
