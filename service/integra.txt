You are working on my Rust Windows desktop app “Novapad” (Win32 UI). I already have:
- A robust RSS engine (rate limiting, retries, caching, cooldown, etc.) in src/tools/rss.rs
- An RSS TreeView UI with NVDA-friendly behavior in src/app_windows/rss_window.rs
- Feed reordering for RSS sources (context menu “Reorder RSS…”, Up/Down/Top/Bottom/Move to position, persistence in settings rss_sources, stable sorting by lParam/index)
- An audio player mode (MP3) with a dynamic top-level “Playback” menu that appears only in audio mode
- An “Announce time” function already implemented (NVDA Controller Client) and a “Go to time…” dialog already implemented.

NEW FEATURE: PODCASTS (Library + Search + Subscribe + Play)
Implement a Podcast window accessible from the existing menu:
- Add a menu entry: Tools -> Podcasts…
- This opens a new window/panel “Podcasts” (do NOT mix with the RSS articles UI).
- Podcast playback must reuse the existing audio player mode: when the user presses Enter on an episode, open/play it with the existing player, and the Playback menu will appear as usual.

UI / Accessibility requirements (very important)
Tab order and focus must be deterministic and screen-reader-friendly:
1) When the Podcast window opens, focus starts on the Podcast Library list (subscribed podcasts).
2) Pressing Tab moves to the Search edit box.
3) Typing a query and pressing Enter performs search and then moves focus to the Search Results list.
4) In Search Results, the user can press Enter on a result to subscribe (add to library).
5) After results, Tab reaches a button “Add podcast from URL…”.
Keep everything fully usable with keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab, arrows, Enter, context menu key).
Do not spam NVDA; only announce key actions (e.g., “Podcast added”, “Removed”, “Updated”).

Tree navigation behavior (important for accessibility)

- The Podcast Library must use a TreeView, like the RSS feeds UI.
- Podcasts are root nodes.
- Episodes are child nodes.
- Right arrow:
  - On a podcast node: expand it and load/show its episodes.
- Left arrow:
  - On a podcast node: collapse it.
  - On an episode node: move focus back to the parent podcast.
- Up/Down arrows navigate between visible nodes.
- Enter:
  - On a podcast node: expand/collapse (if collapsed, expand; if expanded, do nothing or refresh).
  - On an episode node: start playback using the existing audio player mode.

This must follow the same NVDA-friendly rules already used in the RSS TreeView:
- No full TreeView rebuilds during expansion.
- Append-only when possible.
- Keep selection stable.
- Avoid reselecting nodes programmatically.

Data model / integration
- Treat podcasts as feeds under the hood (same caching/limits), but keep them separate from “RSS Articles” in UI and settings:
  - Add a new settings list: podcast_sources (similar structure to rss_sources), including persisted order.
  - Podcast items/episodes are RSS items with audio enclosure (enclosure URL).
- Reuse src/tools/rss.rs for fetching/parsing feed documents, caching (ETag/Last-Modified), rate limits, retries, cooldowns.
- For podcast feed parsing, extract per-episode:
  - title
  - link (optional)
  - pubDate (optional)
  - guid (optional)
  - enclosure URL (audio) + MIME type if present
  - short excerpt/description (truncate like RSS logic; no heavy HTML)
- Dedup logic should reuse existing canonicalization and guid/link hashing approach.

Podcast Window layout (simple, Win32 controls)
- “Library” list (ListBox/ListView or TreeView; choose what fits your codebase)
- “Episodes” list for selected podcast (optional but recommended for usability)
  - If you choose a two-pane design: left = podcasts, right = episodes
  - If you choose one-pane: selecting a podcast shows episodes below
- Search edit box + Search results list
- Button: “Add podcast from URL…”

Behavior
A) Library (subscribed podcasts)
- Arrow keys navigate podcasts.
- Enter on a podcast loads/refreshes episode list (lightweight feed fetch; obey cache/rate limits).
- Context menu on a podcast item must include:
  - Update (refresh feed now)
  - Reorder podcasts… (same UX as RSS reorder: Up/Down/Top/Bottom/Move to position…)
  - Remove podcast
  - Copy feed URL
  - Open feed in browser (optional)
- Reordering must be deterministic and persisted, using the SAME approach as RSS:
  - Update indices in podcast_sources
  - Update lParam/index for stable sort
  - Do not rebuild whole list; keep selection; NVDA-friendly

B) Episodes list
- Show all episode titles (paging optional, but avoid huge UI stalls).
- Enter on an episode:
  - If enclosure URL exists: start playback using existing audio player mode (do not reimplement the player).
  - If missing enclosure: show a short message “No audio URL for this episode”.
- Context menu on an episode must include:
  - Play (same as Enter)
  - Open episode page in browser (if link exists)
  - Copy audio URL (if enclosure exists)
  - Copy episode title
  - (Optional) “Copy episode notes” / “Import notes into editor” if you can reuse existing import-to-editor logic

C) Search (Apple iTunes Search API)
Implement podcast search using Apple iTunes Search API (no API key):
- Query endpoint:
  - https://itunes.apple.com/search?media=podcast&term=<urlencoded>&limit=<N>
- Parse JSON results and list them in “Search Results” (title/artist summary is enough).
- On Enter on a result:
  - Extract feed URL (feedUrl field if present)
  - Add it to podcast_sources (dedupe by feed URL)
  - Announce “Podcast added”
  - Optionally select it in Library and load episodes
- Handle no results gracefully.
- Add basic request limits and timeouts consistent with existing reqwest client.
- Reuse your shared reqwest::Client and limiter logic; do not create a new client.

D) “Add podcast from URL…”
- Opens a small modal dialog with:
  - Label “Feed URL”
  - Edit box
  - OK / Cancel
- On OK, validate URL, add to podcast_sources, then fetch episodes.

Implementation constraints
- Do NOT break existing RSS Articles UI or audio player.
- Keep code maintainable: small functions, clear modules.
- Use async properly (Tokio); do not block UI thread.
- Respect existing NVDA-friendly policies (avoid rebuilds that cause repeated announcements; batch UI updates when adding many items).

Files / modules (suggested)
- src/app_windows/podcast_window.rs (new)
- src/tools/podcast.rs (optional thin wrapper around rss.rs, or reuse rss.rs directly)
- src/settings.rs (add podcast_sources + reorder helpers similar to rss_sources)
- i18n/en.json, i18n/it.json, i18n/es.json, i18n/pt.json (strings for Podcasts UI and context menus)
- Cargo.toml: only add crates if needed for iTunes JSON parsing (serde/serde_json if not already used)

Deliverables
- Working Podcast window reachable from Tools -> Podcasts…
- Library focus on open, Tab order as specified, Enter behavior as specified
- Context menus for:
  - library podcast items (update, reorder, remove, copy URL, etc.)
  - episode items (play, open, copy)
  - search results (subscribe)
- Podcast reordering implemented using the SAME UX and persistence pattern as RSS reordering
- cargo check must pass

Manual acceptance checklist
1) Open Podcasts window: focus starts in Library.
2) Tab to Search box; type query; Enter -> focus goes to Results list.
3) Enter on a result subscribes and adds to Library.
4) Select subscribed podcast -> episodes load.
5) Enter on an episode starts playback with existing player mode + Playback menu.
6) Context menu on podcast: reorder works (Up/Down/Top/Bottom/Move to position), persists after restart.
7) Context menu on episode: Play/Open/Copy work and do not cause NVDA spam.
