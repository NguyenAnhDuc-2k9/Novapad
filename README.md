Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed.
Formatting is enforced with `cargo fmt --check`.

Core text logic is the target for stricter linting/tests.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ambro86/Novapad.git
cd Novapad
cargo build --release
```

Run the application:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
