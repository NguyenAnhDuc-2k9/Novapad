# Changelog
Version 0.5.8 - 2026-01-09
New features
• Added volume control for the microphone and system audio when recording podcasts.
• Added a new feature to import articles from websites or RSS feeds, including the most important feeds for each language.

Improvements

• Added the ability to delete RSS feeds/sites from the library by selecting them and pressing Delete.
