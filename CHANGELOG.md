# Changelog

Version 0.6.0 – 2025-01-20
New features
• Added spell checker. From the context menu, users can check whether the current word is correct and, if not, get spelling suggestions.
• Added podcast import and export via OPML files.
• Added Podcast Index search support in addition to iTunes. Users can enter their free API key and secret (generated using only an email address).
• Added support for SAPI4 voices, both for real-time reading and audiobook creation.
• Added dictionary support using Wiktionary. Pressing the Applications key shows definitions, and when available, synonyms and translations into other languages.
• Added Wikipedia article import with search, result selection, and direct import into the editor.
• Added Shift+Enter shortcut in the RSS module to open an article directly in the original website.
Improvements
• Microphone selection is now always respected by the application.
• In the podcast window, pressing Enter on an episode now immediately announces “loading” via NVDA to confirm the action.
• In podcast search results, pressing Enter now subscribes to the selected podcast.
• Fixed and improved labels for Ctrl+Shift+O and Podcast Ctrl+Shift+P shortcuts.
• Playback speed and volume are now saved in settings and persist across all audio files.
• Added a dedicated cache folder for podcast episodes. Users can keep episodes via “Keep podcast” in the Playback menu. The cache is automatically cleaned when exceeding the user-defined size (Options → Audio).
• Improved RSS article fetching significantly using libcurl impersonation with Chrome and iPhone profiles, ensuring compatibility with ~99% of sites.
• Added read / unread state for RSS articles, with clear indication in the RSS list.
• Replace All now reports the number of replacements performed.
• Added a Delete Podcast button when navigating the podcast library using Tab.
Fixes
• Removed the redundant “pending update” entry from the Help menu (updates are already handled automatically).
• Fixed a bug where pressing Ctrl+S on an opened MP3 file would save and corrupt the file.
• Fixed a UI issue where “Batch Audiobooks” was shown as “(B)… Ctrl+Shift+B” (removed redundant label).
• Fixed smart quotes: when enabled, normal quotes are now correctly replaced with smart quotes.
• Fixed a bug where using “Go to bookmark” reset the playback speed to 1.0.
• Fixed an issue where already-downloaded podcast episodes were re-downloaded instead of using the cached version.
Keyboard shortcuts
• F1 now opens the Help guide.
• F2 now checks for updates.
• F7 / F8 now jump to the previous or next spelling error.
• F9 / F10 now quickly switch between favorite voices.
Developer improvements
• Errors are no longer silently dropped: all let _ = patterns have been removed, and errors are now explicitly handled (propagated, logged, or handled with fallbacks as appropriate).
• The project now fails to compile if there are warnings: both cargo check and cargo clippy must pass cleanly, with lints tightened and allow removed where possible.
• Custom implementations such as strlen / wcslen-style helpers have been removed. String and UTF-16 buffer lengths are now derived from Rust-owned data instead of scanning memory.
• DLL handling has been cleaned up and consolidated around libloading, avoiding custom loader logic and PE parsing.
• Hand-rolled byte parsing helpers were removed; all byte parsing now uses standard from_le_bytes / from_be_bytes on checked slices.
These changes reduce unnecessary unsafe usage, eliminate potential undefined behavior, and make the codebase more idiomatic, robust, and maintainable.
